## Description
In this repository, you will find the code for several important algorithms used in scientific computing. Here's a brief description of each algorithm:

Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT): The DFT is an algorithm that transforms a finite sequence of equally spaced samples of a function into a sequence of complex numbers representing the function in the frequency domain.

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): The FFT is an efficient algorithm for computing the DFT of a sequence, typically reducing the computational complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n). This repository provides implementations for both 1D and 2D FFT.

Noise Cleaning Algorithm using FFT: This algorithm utilizes the FFT to remove noise from signals or images. It applies a frequency-based filtering technique to attenuate unwanted noise components.

JPEG Compression using DCT: The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is used in JPEG compression to convert an image into a frequency-domain representation. This repository includes an implementation of the JPEG compression algorithm using the DCT.
